### What I learned

The project initially looks simple but it takes me a couple of days to complete it . Since i am not wellfound of css i really struggled to make it responsive .


### Continued development

Still i left some problems with its responsivness  and typography used, will make it better soon.
Also i wish to focus on add some animation effects and styling using some webpacks and libraries in the future.
